# TFLN-your-friends
a php-mailer project to send TFLN texts to a phone number without paying for a special text address
uses php mailer and a little known texting feature where an email to a phone number followed by a carrier-specific email address will be forwarded as a text to that phone number for free.
We were using the newest Texts From Last Night posts to fill in some garbage text to send to our victim.
Used to use a service by kiminko labs to scrape a page for information and build an api out of it, it looks like that service isn't free anymore so we'll have to build our own.
